Notes - 

1. Imputer is used to fill Nan Values with the column mean orbe converted to median
2. Label Encoder is used to transform words to numbers for eg. Cake will 1
3. One hot encoderr is used to transform the values Means when we apply labelencoder then a column gets many values many unique values so due to this our model would gget confused for avoiding this we use one hot encoder.
